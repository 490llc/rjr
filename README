I. Intro
=====================================================
Simrpc is a simple Ruby module for rpc communication, 
that uses Apache QPID as the transport mechanism. 

II. Using
=====================================================
Until I write a tutorial, the simrpc test suite 
should detail common usage. The Simrpc API 
http://projects.morsi.org/simrpc/doc/  (generated
from rdoc) details the complete interface

III. TODO
=====================================================
 Efficiency improvements
 C++ rewrite, w/ Ruby and other wrappers, so
  Simrpc can be used as across-languages
